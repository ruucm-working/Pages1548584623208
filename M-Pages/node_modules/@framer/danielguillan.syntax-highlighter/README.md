# Overview
Highlight code snippets using more than 70 popular themes including Atom One, Monokai, Tomorrow Night, Solarized, Zenburn, and more.

# Usage
1. Create a text layer containing the code snippet you want to highlight.
2. Wrap it in a Frame (⌘ + ↵).
4. Drop a SyntaxHighlighter component in the canvas.
5. Link the Frame containing the code snippet to the SyntaxHighlighter.

From the component properties you can choose the theme and language, add padding to the container, toggle line numbers, and toggle focus mode.

# Focus Mode
With Focus mode enabled you can highlight specific lines from your code snippet. The `Focus lines` property accepts a list of comma separated line numbers (e.g. `1, 7, 9`) and line ranges (e.g. `6-9, 21-28`). You can also combine ranges and individual lines: `1, 6-9, 18, 20, 26-29`.

# Upcoming features
- Ability to set the typeface and font size.
- Edit code right within the component in the canvas (not sure this is even possible).
